CappGraph library for Cappuccino (http://cappuccino.org)

CappGraph is a very simple graphing library for Cappuccino. It utilizes the Flot graphing library for jQuery, found at http://code.google.com/p/flot/.
The Cappuccino library is basically a wrapper for Flot, so for a complete documentation document, refer to the official Flot documentation.

Basic Cappuccino/Objective-J usage:

First of all, before the Flot graph is ready for methods to be called on it, you must wait for the jQuery/HTML document to finish loading.
For your class to 'know' when jQuery and Flot are ready, you must delegate the functionality from CappGraph.

Graph theGraph = [[Graph alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMakeZero()];
[theGraph setDelegate:self];

To recieve the message that the graph has loaded, implement the following method:

- (void) graphViewDidFinishLoading:(Graph) theGraph {
	// do something once the graph is loaded
}

Once that delegate method has been recieved, you're ready to graph data!

Example of graphing basic data (once again, utilize the Flot documentation to see what it can really do):

- (void) graphViewDidFinishLoading:(Graph) theGraph {
	// add some data to our graph/plot
	[theGraph addPlot:@"The Title" data:[[1, 2], [2, 4]]]; // just 2 points (makes a line) with a label
	[theGraph refreshGraph]; // actually load available data into the graph
	
	[theGraph removePlotWithLabel:@"The Title"]; // removes the graph with title @"The Title" from the stack
	[theGraph refreshGraph]; // actually shows the changes (should now be an empty graph)
}

That's all there is to know for now!

Thank you!
